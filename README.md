It is everything you need to handle your precious data.

![](docs/doge-big-data-meme.jpg)

The primary aim of this package is to make it easy to work with big data. What do I mean by *big* is the size of course. While training a deep neural network architecture, sometimes, it can be a headache to work with large image or video files. In the case of large image and video files, it is generally not possible to load data in an offline manner. 

This package provides a flexibility of the *online/offline* data loading option combined with a custom iterator which makes it very handy to feed data to neural network structure.
